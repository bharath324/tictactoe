# tictactoe

This is an assignment project for developing a TicTacToe game in Java.
This project supports two modes
  1. Single Player (Man vs Computer)
  2. Two Player (Man vs Man)
For each of the above mode, the game has 2 variations as following,
  1. Standard Game ( 'X' & 'O')
      1. In this game a two players 'X' and 'O' starts placing the characters on the TicTacToe board.
      2. Who ever has a line (row, column, diagonal, reverse diagonal) with same letter i.e 'XXX' or 'OOO' then that player wins.
  2. OddEven Game 
      1. One player is Even who can only use even numbers 2,4,6,8 and place on the board.
      2. Other player is Odd who can only use odd numbers 1,3,5,7,9 and place on baord.
      3. On any player's move if the line (row, column, diagonal, reverse diagonal) has 3 numbers whose sum is 15, that player wins.
      4. For E.g. if row has [5 8 'empty'] and it's even player's turn and he places 2 in empty, then he wins (5 + 8 + 2 = 15)
